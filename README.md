# PhoneBook
This is just a Contact storing app which helps you to Call or Send SMS to the stored contacts. The key feature of the application is that it will never store duplicate contacts(it notifies the user if the contact is already saved). It gives you the last call log after the end of every call. It demonstrates MVVM architecture, RxJava, Room, Dagger, Notifications, View Binding, etc.
